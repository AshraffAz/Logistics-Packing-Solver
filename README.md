## Introduction

This project aims to develop an efficient 3D bin packing algorithm, tailored for optimizing space utilization in logistic operations. The algorithm will accommodate real-world constraints such as the orientation of specific items.

### Features

- **Layer-based Packing:** The algorithm categorizes items based on their dimensions, grouping them into layers for optimized space utilization.
  
- **Visualizations:** Integrated visualization tools provide a clear 3D representation of how items are packed within the bins.
  
- **Adaptive Approach:** The algorithm adjusts to different bin sizes and shapes, ensuring flexibility across various logistic scenarios.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `src` directory to view the source code.
3. Run the main script to execute the algorithm and view visualizations.

### Documentation

For a detailed breakdown of the project's progress, methodologies, and future plans, refer to the `PROGRESS.md` file. Additional documentation can be found in the `docs` folder.

### Future Scope

The ongoing development will further refine the layer-based approach, incorporate dynamic adjustments based on real-world feedback, and enhance the visualization capabilities. Additionally, strategies to protect intellectual property while showcasing the project's capabilities are under consideration.
