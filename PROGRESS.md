# Project Progress - 3D Bin Packing Algorithm

## Initial Objectives

- Develop an algorithm that optimizes space utilization in 3D bins.
- Ensure the algorithm can handle real-world constraints such as item orientations.
- Integrate visualization tools to provide a clear representation of packed bins.

## Milestones Achieved

1. **Class Structures:** Established foundational classes for items and bins, allowing for flexibility in item dimensions, weights, and orientations.
  
2. **Layer-based Approach:** Implemented a greedy method to group items into layers based on dimensions, enhancing space utilization.
  
3. **Visualization Integration:** Developed a visualization module, enabling 3D visual representation of packed items within bins. 

4. **Client Engagement:** Proactively engaged with a medium-sized logistics company, visiting their warehouse to gather insights into daily operations, ensuring the software's practical applicability.

## Ongoing Work

- **Gravity Considerations:** Ensuring that items are packed in a manner consistent with real-world gravitational constraints to prevent toppling.
  
- **Layer Optimization:** Further refining the layer-based approach to accommodate a wider variety of item dimensions and orientations.

## Future Roadmap

1. **Dynamic Adjustments:** Incorporate feedback loops to allow the algorithm to learn and adjust based on real-world packing results.
  
2. **Enhanced Visualizations:** Expand visualization capabilities to provide different planar views and detailed item information.
  
3. **Intellectual Property:** Evaluate strategies to protect the project's intellectual property while still showcasing its capabilities and results.
